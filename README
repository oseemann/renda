Running on a headless system
----------------------------

The program requires an X11 session. On a headless server you can start one
using e.g. Xvfb. Make sure to select an unused display number:

   $ Xvfb :1 -screen scrn 640x480x24

The screen resolution has no effect on the rendering. The color depth does,
however. Alternatively to Xfvb, you can use VNC:

   $ vncserver :1 -depth 24 

Use the -display switch to select the newly created X display:

   $ renda -display :1 -i out.png http://www.google.com
